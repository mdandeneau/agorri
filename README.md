# Agorri

Government you can see. A voice they can count.

A static site (one page plus JSON data) with two small Cloudflare Pages Functions:
- `/api/feed` merges the official feeds in `feeds.json` (city RSS, city YouTube, officials on Bluesky). Cached 5 minutes; the page polls it every 5 minutes.
- `/api/ask` writes short answers for the search bar from the records the page matched. Off until you add an API key.

Data refreshes daily through a scheduled Claude task that follows `UPDATE.md` and pushes to `main`.

## Go live on Cloudflare Pages (about 15 minutes, free)

1. Create a free Cloudflare account at https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up.
2. Workers & Pages > Create > Pages > Connect to Git. Pick this repository.
3. Build settings: Framework preset **None**. Build command **blank**. Build output directory **/**. Save and Deploy.
   The site is live at `<project>.pages.dev`, with `/api/feed` working.
4. Domain: in Cloudflare, add the site `agorri.com` (Free plan) and change the nameservers at your registrar to the two Cloudflare gives you. An apex domain on Pages requires this. Then in the Pages project > Custom domains, add `agorri.com` and `www.agorri.com`.
5. Optional, for written answers in search: Settings > Variables and Secrets > add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Encrypt), then redeploy. Get a key at https://console.anthropic.com and set a monthly spend limit there. Uses Claude Haiku 5.5 (about $0.0004 per question). Set `ANSWER_MODEL` to change models.
6. Optional: add a rate-limiting rule for `/api/ask` under Security if your plan includes one.

## Files
- `index.html`: the whole site.
- `portsmouth.json`, `local.json`, `beyond.json`: Portsmouth's data. `towns.json`: town registry (add a town by adding its files and one entry). `feeds.json`: live feed sources.
- `docs/DATA_GUIDE.md`: field definitions. `UPDATE.md`: the daily refresh runbook.
- `scripts/check.mjs`: validates the data before a push. `scripts/test-feed.mjs`: offline tests for the feed function.

Run locally: `npx wrangler pages dev .` (runs the functions too).
